AutomationML is an open neutral XML based data exchange format used in automation systems. It has come into the public for more than 10 years and is being used in many different areas in all kinds of manufacturing applications, such as digital twin, reconfigurable manufacturing systems, heterogeneous data exchange, etc. However, no comprehensive literature review on the research and application progress of AutomationML has been found since the initiation of AutomationML. Based on the study and analysis of AutomationML related publications, this paper gives a detailed illustration on the state-of-the-art of AutomationML. Firstly, the background and terminologies related to AutomationML are introduced. Secondly, the paper applies a methodology to collect AutomationML related publications, on which an analysis based on a multidimensional literature classification is conducted. Thirdly, according to the analysis results, current research status and whether AutomationML can meet the requirements for industry 4.0 environment are discussed. Finally, conclusion and outlook are illustrated in the end.
